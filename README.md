# Light

"Light" iOS app created for App Studio, Unit 1.

## Getting Started

To run "Light", download the source code, open with Xcode, and run on iOS simulator or your own iOS device. The app works with all available iOS devices/simulators. 

## Running the app

The app has two simple functions. By tapping the screen anywhere, the background color will change from black to white and vice versa. The app also has a centered button, S.O.S., which will signal these letters in morse code by changing the screen background color. To fully make use of the screen estate, the status bar has been disabled.


## Built With

* [Xcode](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The IDE for macOS to create iOS apps
