# Light

"Light" iOS app created for App Studio, Unit 1.

## Exercises

The folder "Exercises" contains my answers to the Student Resources Playground questions. Exercise 1 - Introduction somehow didn't open properly after commmit, therefore I added it as a text file as well.


## Getting Started

To run "Light", download the source code, open with Xcode, and run on iOS simulator or your own iOS device. It works with all available iOS devices/simulators.

## Running the app

The app has two simple functions. By tapping the screen anywhere, the background color will change from black to white and vice versa. The app also has a centered button, S.O.S., which will signal these letters in morse code by changing the background color. To fully make use of the screen estate, the status bar has been disabled.
